# AutoTel-Shared-Car-Availability-Prediction
AutoTel is a company in Israel which offers a service of car sharing to its customers. Suppose you are in a urgency and in hurry to reach somewhere in Israel. You need a car to reach there but donâ€™t have one of your own. AutoTel Shared Car Service is there for you. But it is not always possible to get a car whenever we want. As sometimes we may be in such a place where AutoTel service is not available at that moment. Then, how a customer, who is in hurry, would get to know that waiting for a AutoTel service in that area at that time will be a good decision or not? This classification we are going to do using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
